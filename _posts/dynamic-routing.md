This year, I was able to go to ManageEngine's ITCon and I have nothing but good things to say. The events top takeaways from this event are that Manage Engine has a complete suite of over 120 information technology solutions available. This event was hosted at the Westin in Southfield and the venue proved to be amazing. Manage Engine had a full day planned for us and the event had a great turn out overall. I was pretty impressed at the corporation's ability to keep its technology updated with AI, cloud integration, machine learning, and zero trust. Getting into the highlights of the event, as it'd be near impossible to summarize the whole spectacle.

I found the Service Desk Pro demonstration pretty compelling. Charles Arokiaraj Ignatius was one of ManageEngine's many subject matter experts onsite to give us a breakdown of each platform along with walkthrough of their demo instances. The solution has a lot of features and functionality to make the IT and operations experience easier for non-technical people in business. The platform not only allowed for different service desk instances for different departments such as IT, facilities, and HR, the whole end user interface was customizable with a drag and drop WYSIWYG html editor. The most underrated part of this platform was its ability to execute code on connected hosts with the ManageEngine agent installed. This feature allowed for workflows to be created to automate AD configuration and configure systems remotes via SSH and PowerShell.

Throughout the day, I never stopped learning about how new technology was getting incorporated into company's operations. Ashwin A from ManageEngine's technical team really nailed it with his deep dive into their approach at incorporating AI into IT operations. This solution provides a way for organizations to automate workflows related to virtually all areas of network infrastructure. Their AIOps platform delivers a single interface for traffic analysis through SNMP, compliance, anomaly detection and automation. By the end of this presentation, I had a good overview of how to elevate a company's IT operations with their AI driven full stack management tool.

Aside from ManageEngine's knowledgeable speakers, we also got a chance to compete in a conference quiz for swag. I loved that we had a chance to interact with the other people at the event and its hosts. I was able to connect with some other information security professionals while I was there and learned about what's new and cutting edge in the tech world. I was even able to see a really cool raspberry pi zero with a RFID scanner, and some other cool white hat hacking capabilities. I could go on and on - there was a lot of good information and educated IT professionals there to network with. These were my top highlights from this year's ITCon in Southfield Michigan. I can't wait to see this corporation at future events and conferences!
